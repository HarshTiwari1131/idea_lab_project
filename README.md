more thing is need to written by me wait for some time when code is complete it will write this documentation for my project which has been working by members of ace and this is important note that no a person can change any thing to this read me file only leader can write this so other member of ace you can only work on coding work not work on change any thing to this readme file and also hint for members that when you run this code then ask contact me so i will help you to solve 56 error in this file if you will not take it seares it will not work properly o ask after running the code 


when you run the code first you will not go throw to the any extra code file 
hint 

Step 1 
open all files in vs code 

then edit main.py

then run main.py code that has been 1 to 125 lines not run any rest of commented code or not to be oversmart to make changes 

i will tell you what thing will you have to do you can only work on gui interface and stop speak function 
all rest of issue on this code has been fixed by leader so you can only focus on that thing i will tell not work on extra featurs because i have already has many function in my seprate file so i am workiing on it and you can work on mongodb database beacuse i will not work on any online data store so you can focus on that part
